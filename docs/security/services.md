## 🗄️ Security for CogStack provided other services

### General services TLS configuration

All services in cogstack that are not listed in `deploy/services.yml`and use TLS will be described on this page. For services that are still part of the stack but in `dervices/<SERVICE_NAME>` (again, service not also present in `deploy/services.yml`) the TLS setup is handled differently, and the setup is described in each service's README.md. Generally, most should just use the root-ca certs from `security/certificates/root/`.

### Gitea TLS Configuration

This section describes how **Gitea** is secured using the shared **Root Certificate Authority (CA)** generated by `create_root_ca_cert.sh`.

Unlike other services (such as NiFi or Elastic), **Gitea does not require its own dedicated certificate pair** or an NGINX reverse proxy.
It operates directly with the **Root CA** to provide HTTPS encryption and mutual trust within the CogStack-NiFi stack.

### 📁 Certificate source

All certificates used by Gitea originate from:

```text
security/certificates/root/
```

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `root-ca.pem` | Public CA certificate used by Gitea for HTTPS trust |
| `root-ca.key` | Root CA private key (used only when generating new certificates) |
| `root-ca.p12` | Optional PKCS#12 keystore (not required by Gitea) |

### 🧠 Notes

- The **Root CA** (`root-ca.pem`) is shared across all CogStack services for internal TLS trust.
- You do **not** need to create a new `gitea.crt` or `gitea.key`; the Root CA cert/key pair is sufficient.
- Ensure `root-ca.key` remains private and is not committed to version control.
- The same CA also secures NiFi, ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, Kibana, and JupyterHub.

### ✅ Verification

To confirm Gitea is serving HTTPS correctly:

```bash
curl -vk --cacert ./security/certificates/root/root-ca.pem https://gitea.local:2222/
```

You should see a valid TLS handshake and an HTTP 200 response.
