# 📦 Deployment

The [`deploy`](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-NiFi/tree/main/deploy/) directory contains an example dockerized deployment setup of the customised NiFi image, along with related services for document processing, NLP, and text analytics.

Make sure you have read the [Prerequisites](./main.md) section before proceeding.

## 🗂️ Key files

- **`services.yml`** – defines the *core* services that are orchestrated directly from this repository via Docker Compose.   (Kubernetes-based multi-container deployments are coming soon.)

- **`Makefile`** – provides convenient commands for starting, stopping, and managing the deployment.

- **`.env` files in `./deploy/`** , environment variables used across services, specifications:
  - environment variables that apply **only to the services defined inside `services.yml`**.  
  - Security-related `.env` files (certificates, users) are under **`/security`**

  These variables configure NiFi, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, Kibana, Jupyter, Metricbeat, the sample DB, etc.

> **Important:** If you run `docker compose` directly (instead of `make`), first load the envs with:
>
> ```bash
> source ./deploy/export_env_vars.sh
> ```
>
> The Makefile targets already do this for you.

## 🧩 Modular service design (important)

This repository follows a **modular deployment model**:

- Only the services defined in **`services.yml`** use the environment files located in **`./deploy/*.env`**.  
- **All other services** included in the ecosystem are launched via `docker-compose` commands inside their own directories, for example:  

  ```bash
  ./services/<service_name>/docker/docker-compose.yml
  ```

- Each of these standalone services maintains **its own environment configuration** in:

  ```bash
  ./services/<service_name>/env/
  ```

This design allows each service to be:

- independently configurable  
- versioned and deployed in isolation  
- consumed by other projects without modifying the core deployment  

> These are the files you will most commonly modify when creating or adjusting a deployment.

## ⚙️ Additional service configuration

- Service-specific configurations are located under:  
  [`./services`](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-NiFi/tree/main/services/)
- NiFi-specific configuration (properties, custom processors, drivers, Python scripts, etc.) is under:  
  [`./nifi`](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-NiFi/tree/main/nifi/)

## 🧰 Makefile Command Overview

A concise reference for controlling the full CogStack deployment stack (NiFi, Elasticsearch, JupyterHub, MedCAT, OCR-service, GitEA, Beats, DB, etc.).  
All commands automatically load environment variables via `export_env_vars.sh`.

### 🔎 Discover available Make targets

You can list all available `deploy/Makefile` targets with descriptions:

```bash
# from repository root
make -C deploy help
```

```bash
# from ./deploy
make help
```

### 🌐 Manage a specific service on a specific machine

Use remote targets to run Docker Compose on a remote host over SSH.

Prerequisites:

- SSH access to the target machine
- this repository checked out on the target machine
- Docker + Docker Compose available on the target machine

```bash
# deploy (up -d)
make -C deploy remote-deploy-service \
  REMOTE_HOST=ubuntu@10.20.0.15 \
  REMOTE_REPO_DIR=/opt/cogstack_nifi \
  REMOTE_SERVICES="nifi nifi-nginx" \
  REMOTE_SSH_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/cogstack_prod.pem \
  REMOTE_COMPOSE_FILE=services.yml
```

```bash
# stop
make -C deploy remote-stop-service \
  REMOTE_HOST=ubuntu@10.20.0.15 \
  REMOTE_REPO_DIR=/opt/cogstack_nifi \
  REMOTE_SERVICES="nifi nifi-nginx" \
  REMOTE_SSH_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/cogstack_prod.pem \
  REMOTE_COMPOSE_FILE=services.yml
```

```bash
# delete containers (docker compose rm -f -s)
make -C deploy remote-delete-service \
  REMOTE_HOST=ubuntu@10.20.0.15 \
  REMOTE_REPO_DIR=/opt/cogstack_nifi \
  REMOTE_SERVICES="nifi nifi-nginx" \
  REMOTE_SSH_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/cogstack_prod.pem \
  REMOTE_COMPOSE_FILE=services.yml
```

- Set `REMOTE_SERVICES` to one service (for example `kibana`) or multiple services.
- Use `services.dev.yml` by setting `REMOTE_COMPOSE_FILE=services.dev.yml`.
- `REMOTE_SSH_KEY` is optional; if omitted, normal SSH config/agent auth is used.
- `REMOTE_SSH_OPTS` is optional for extra flags (for example `-p 2222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`).
- `remote-delete-service` removes containers; it does not remove volumes.

| `make cleanup`   | Full teardown, including volumes            |

---

### 📝 Notes

- All `start-*` commands use `docker compose -f services.yml` unless referencing a specific service’s Dockerfile.
- `start-all` and `stop-all` act as the top-level orchestration entry points.
- Environment variables are **always sourced** using the integrated `WITH_ENV` macro.

---

If you want, I can also generate a **minimal cheat sheet**, or an **ASCII tree diagram** that shows how `start-all` expands into all services.

## 🚀 Starting the Services

All core services defined in `services.yml` can be started using the Makefile in the `deploy/` directory.

For most services in the `services` folder that are not part of the core stack defined in `services.yml` and are pulled from external git submodule repositories, the start-up process is the same.

### ▶️ Start each service individually

You can start individual components of the CogStack-NiFi stack using the `make start-*` commands.  
Each target loads all required environment variables automatically via `export_env_vars.sh`.

This is useful for:

- debugging a single service  
- restarting only one component after config changes  
- running lightweight subsets of the stack  
- isolating problems or logs per service  

---

### 🧩 Core NiFi Services

```bash
make start-nifi
```

Starts:

- **nifi** — the Apache NiFi instance (main ETL/orchestration engine)  
- **nifi-nginx** — reverse proxy/front-end for NiFi  

Use when you want to run, debug, or modify NiFi workflows without bringing up the entire ecosystem.

---

### 🏗️ Start Core Data Infrastructure

```bash
make start-data-infra
```

Starts:

- NiFi
- NiFi Nginx
- Elasticsearch  
- Samples DB  

Ideal for running ingestion pipelines and ETL workflows.

---

#### 🛢️ Elasticsearch / OpenSearch Services

Please note that to switch from OpenSearch (Amazon open-source fork) to ElasticSearch you will need to change some environment variables, see the [configuration](./configuration.md) section.

```bash
make start-elastic
```

Starts the standard 2-node Elasticsearch cluster + Kibana.

```bash
make start-elastic-cluster
```

Starts all 3 ES nodes. Useful for testing clustering, sharding, and replication.

```bash
make start-elastic-1
make start-elastic-2
make start-elastic-3
```

Start individual Elasticsearch nodes for debugging or failure-scenario testing.

---

#### 📈 Kibana

```bash

make start-production-db
```

Starts the **cogstack-databank-db** production database.

Use when testing SQL ingestion or verifying DB-driven NiFi flows.

---

### 📚 JupyterHub

```

Starts the full MedCAT Trainer stack (Trainer UI + Solr + NGINX). Useful for annotation and supervised training tasks.

---

### 📝 OCR Services

```bash
make start-ocr-services
```

Starts:

- **ocr-service** — main OCR pipeline  
- **ocr-service-text-only** — lightweight OCR/text extraction  

Use for PDF ingestion, OCR debugging, and pipeline validation.

---

### 🛠️ Miscellaneous Services (GIT EA)

```bash
make start-git-ea
```

Starts the internal Gitea Git server used for local code/config storage.

---

### 🚀 Start the Entire Stack

```bash
make start-all
```

Starts everything:

- Core infra
- JupyterHub  
- MedCAT NLP services  
- OCR services  

Use for complete deployments, demos, or full-stack development.
