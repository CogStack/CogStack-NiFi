# Introduction
This repository proposes a possible next step for the free-text data processing capabilities implemented as [CogStack-Pipeline](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-Pipeline), shaping the solution more towards Platform-as-a-Service.
CogStack-NiFi contains example recipes using [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) as the key data workflow engine with a set of services for documents processing with NLP. 
Each component implementing key functionality, such as Text Extraction or Natural Language Processing, runs as a service where the data routing between the components and data source/sink is handled by Apache NiFi.
Moreover, NLP services are expected to implement an uniform RESTful API to enable easy plugging-in into existing document processing pipelines, making it possible to use any NLP application in the stack.
 
**Important!**
Please note that the project it is under development and is not production-ready.


# Project organisation
The project is organised in the following directories:
- [`nifi`](./nifi) - custom Docker image of Apache NiFi with configuration files, drivers, example workflows and custom user resources,
- [`security`](./security) - scripts to generate SSL keys and certificates for Apache NiFi and related services (when needed) with other security-related requirements,
- [`services`](./services) - available services with their corresponding configuration files and resources,
- [`deploy`](./deploy) - an example deployment of Apache NiFi with related services.
- [`scripts`](./scripts) - helper scripts such as the one ingesting samples into Elasticsearch.

For more information please refer to individual README files provided in each of these directories.

As a good starting point, please see deployment [README](./deploy/README.md) for more details on running an example project deployment.
