# CogStack-NiFi

## Introduction

This repository proposes a possible next step in the evolution of free-text data processing originally implemented in [CogStack-Pipeline](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-Pipeline), moving towards a more modular, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) approach.

**CogStack-NiFi** demonstrates how to use [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) as the central data workflow engine for clinical document processing, integrating services such as text extraction and natural language processing (NLP). Each component runs as a standalone service, with NiFi handling data routing between components and data sources/sinks.

All NLP services are expected to implement a uniform RESTful API, allowing seamless integration into existing pipelines‚Äîmaking it easy to incorporate any NLP application into the stack.
