# ðŸ§Š Freeze all local certificates and OpenSearch config from Git tracking
#
# Usage:
#     ./freeze_certs.sh
#
# Prevents Git from showing diffs, pull conflicts, or accidental commits for:
#   - Root CA certs (./security/root)
#   - NiFi certs (./security/nifi)
#   - OpenSearch/Elastic certs (./security/elastic)
#   - OpenSearch/Elastic internal roles/users (./security/es_roles)
#
# This is meant for local or per-deployment certs/configs that should not interfere
# with shared Git history. Safe to run multiple times.
