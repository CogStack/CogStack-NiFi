# IMPORTANT:
#   Mode in which annotation entities should be outputted in the JSON response,
#   by default this is set to "list" of dicts, so the output would be : {"annotations": [{"id": "0", "cui" : "C1X..", ..}, {"id":"1", "cui": "...."}]}
#   newer versions of MedCAT (1.2+) output entities as a dict, where the id of the entity is a key and the rest of the data is a value, so for "dict",
#   the output is
#    {"annotations": {"entities": {"0": {"cui": "C0027361", "id": 0,.....}, "1": {"cui": "C001111", "id": 1......}}
#   Be mindful of this option as it can affect other services that rely directly on the responses of the service 
#    (the NiFi groovy scripts and annotation ingester are two such services that process the output, and so they might require further customisation)
# POSSIBLE VALUES: [list, dict], if left empty then "dict" is the default.
